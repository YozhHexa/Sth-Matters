经济独立，思想独立，no need.

No need, so you can want.

“需要”是一种软弱， “想要”则是一种强大。

“需要”得到了满足，得到的是恩赏和救济，要磨损人格和尊严。

“想要”得到了满足，得到的是自己主动作为的回报，是对自由和努力的享受。

自己处理好自己的“需要”（need），然后凭着你自己的能力和筹码，去追求你欲求的一切（want）。

Don't ever say "I need you."

I don't need you, and you don't need me.

You might think you do, but you don't really.

You'll see this when I'm gone.

  

I can live without you, happily.

yes, I really can,no matter who you are or what you are.

And believe me, you can too.

You will see this when I’m gone.

  

I just want you.

You are wanted, my dear.

  

Run away if you don’t want to be caught.

Run, and you will be free of me.

I am the laziest hunter you will ever meet.

  

Say no if you only need me.

Say no if you don’t want me.

  

I want you to want me.

  
And believe me,

you want that too.
